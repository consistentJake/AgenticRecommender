Humans believe their strongest edge is their “taste” — their ability to choose.
Here, “taste” means:
1. Personal judgment
Humans pick what feels aesthetically right, emotionally right, morally right — not just statistically optimal.
2. Preference shaped by life experience
Taste comes from culture, memory, personality, past pain, and lived experience.
 AI doesn’t live, so it doesn’t form taste — it only imitates patterns.
3. Non-rational choosing
Humans can choose against the data, against logic, against efficiency — and still feel it’s “right.”
 Art, design, romance, creativity… all depend on taste.
4. Identity-driven decisions
Taste reflects who you are, not just what works.
By “taste,” he means a mix of aesthetic, qualitative judgment: ideas that feel “beautiful, simple, elegant” and consistent with what we know about biological intelligence
