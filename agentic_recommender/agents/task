1. review the design here /Users/zhenkai/Documents/personal/Projects/AgenticRecommender/agentic_recommender/agents, you can use readme.md to quickly catup.
2. take a short and glimpe of the dataset in /Users/zhenkai/Documents/personal/Projects/AgenticRecommender/datasets/sg/train.jsonl, it is too big a file, just take a glimpe.
3. I want you to rethink about the design of this part of the code /Users/zhenkai/Documents/personal/Projects/AgenticRecommender/agentic_recommender/agents,
a. we should make the code to adapt to the dataset, you can refer to /Users/zhenkai/Documents/personal/Projects/AgenticRecommender/finetune/scripts/finetune_lora.py about how it construct the chat message to Qwen3 model through chat template
b. in reflector, we should try to include users that are similar to the current user, we would like to use swing similarity to calculate the top 5 similiar customers.  include these similar user information, but using top 5 but we also have a threshold, if similiarity too low then we exclude the similiar user from consideration too
c. in reflector, we wil ask the LLM about the first round of llm judegement results, and consider the top similiar user then make the final descion, with reasoning.
d. create a unified module to allow agent to use different LLM model for reasoning task, first priotity is using claude API.
## requirement.
1. thinking harder, design first
2. do some research, give us some feedback if this is the good apporach to improve the recommendation task
3. write design doc under /Users/zhenkai/Documents/personal/Projects/AgenticRecommender/agentic_recommender/agents/doc
