So I would like 2 to write out the designs. Dog So let’s what do you want to do? What I want you to These are what very clearly was Thank Call the working phones. So we want to have 2 kind of datasets. First is the delivery hero, and second one is Hero Home Beauty. Which is the same of the LLM-sequential-recommendations, (paper  is papers/Improving Sequential Recommendations with LLMs.pdf, code is in previousWorks/LLM-Sequential-Recommendation ). Paper. And with that, the true data set, We Follow the Same way To prepare the datasets. And I want it to focus on one Recommendation task is the sequential recommendations. In the next We want to make it as a agentic So this agent to workflow We can follow the MacRec  Paper (paper is papers/MacRec.pdf, code is previousWorks/MACRec) The MacRec paper will have the manager and Analyst. Understanding how MacRec is trying to strcutre its agents, and how their communication work. Then its recommendation result will be Verified, metrics  you can also find it in the LLM-sequential-recommendations. Using the same  matrix They use. And later what we want to do is we add a reflector section So reflector is following the idea in the MarRec. And What will, more advanced feature we want to do is for the for the for the training, but for the for the the core of the model. The idea is from ThinkRec (paper is papers/thinkRec.pdf, code is previousWorks/ThinkRec). I want it to be trained with both recommendation task and the reasoning task, learn its design and loss function. Try to break down the tasks, and add the right reference of local paper and code, think hard in each task, of complete the design document step by step.
