The user's ratings for Star Wars: Episode II is 3.5, which is decent, but they haven't watched the original ones. However, their other movies include a lot of lower-rated films, like Batman Returns, Mrs. Doubtfire, The Devil's Advocate, etc. But they also have some higher-rated ones like The Fifth Element (4.0) and Enemy at the Gates (3.0). \n\nWait, but the user's ratings for the Star Wars movies they've seen are 3.5 for Episode II and 2.0 for Episode III (assuming that's the case). But the candidate is Episode VI, which is part of the original trilogy. The user hasn't seen any of the original trilogy movies.
